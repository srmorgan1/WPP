⏺ I can see the issues clearly now:

  1. test_main_exception_handling - The function signature changed to include more parameters, but the mock is not set up
  correctly
  2. test_report_qube_import_errors and test_validate_account_designation_consistency_violations - These tests expect to_excel to
   be called, but the functions now use the OutputHandler pattern instead of direct Excel writing

  Let me examine the actual functions to understand the changes:

⏺ Read(src/wpp/UpdateDatabase.py)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me find the _report_qube_import_errors function:

⏺ Search(pattern: "def _report_qube_import_errors", path: "src/wpp")
  ⎿  Found 1 file (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "def _report_qube_import_errors", path: "src/wpp/UpdateDatabase.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 13 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me also check the _validate_account_designation_consistency function:

⏺ Search(pattern: "def _validate_account_designation_consistency", path: "src/wpp/UpdateDatabase.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 13 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I need to see more of these functions to understand how they use the output_handler:

⏺ Search(pattern: "_report_qube_import_errors", path: "src/wpp/UpdateDatabase.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 43 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now let me check the validation function too:

⏺ Search(pattern: "output_handler\.add_sheet.*Account Validation Problems", path: "src/wpp/UpdateDatabase.py", output_mode:
        "content")
  ⎿  Found 9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now I understand the issue. The functions now use output_handler.add_sheet() instead of direct to_excel() calls. Let me examine
   the test files to understand what needs to be fixed:

⏺ Read(tests/test_UpdateDatabase_error_cases.py)
  ⎿  Read 80 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now I'll fix the three failing tests. Let me start by creating the fixes:

  ⎿  Found 9 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The issue is that the test is mocking the wrong function. The main function signature has changed and now it doesn't require as
   many mocks. Let me see how the test is calling it:

⏺ Read(tests/test_RunReports.py)
  ⎿  Read 50 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me check what run_reports_core function looks like since the error shows that's what's being called:

⏺ Search(pattern: "def run_reports_core", path: "src/wpp/RunReports.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 18 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I need to update the test to mock the right function. The issue is that the test needs to be fixed to work with the current
  architecture. Let me update it:

⏺ Good progress! One test is now passing. I need to fix:

  1. The main exception handling test - it's not catching the exception properly due to the decorator
  2. The validation test - the sheet name is "Account Designation Issues", not "Account Validation Problems"

  Let me fix these:

⏺ Update(tests/test_UpdateDatabase_error_cases.py)
  ⎿  Updated tests/test_UpdateDatabase_error_cases.py with 1 addition and 1 removal

⏺ Let me find where the log_exceptions decorator is being used:

⏺ Search(pattern: "log_exceptions", path: "src/wpp/RunReports.py", output_mode: "content")

⏺ Maybe the decorator isn't being used anymore. Let me check how the main function handles exceptions:

⏺ Read(src/wpp/RunReports.py)
  ⎿  Read 17 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ The main function doesn't have exception handling, so the test shouldn't expect the exception to be caught. The test is testing
   the wrong behavior. Let me update it to expect the exception to be raised:

⏺ Update(tests/test_RunReports.py)
  ⎿  Updated tests/test_RunReports.py with 3 additions and 8 removals

⏺ Excellent! All 228 tests are now passing. Let me mark this task as completed:

⏺ Summary

  I successfully fixed all 3 failing test cases:

  1. test_main_exception_handling: Updated to properly test the main function's exception handling behavior, which allows
  exceptions to propagate rather than catching them.
  2. test_report_qube_import_errors: Fixed to use the new OutputHandler pattern instead of expecting direct to_excel calls. The
  test now verifies that output_handler.add_sheet() is called with the correct parameters.
  3. test_validate_account_designation_consistency_violations: Updated to use OutputHandler and corrected the expected sheet name
   to "Account Designation Issues" instead of "Account Validation Problems". Also fixed the metadata assertions.

  All tests now pass (228/228) and the codebase maintains its high test coverage while working with the new OutputHandler
  architecture that was introduced to support both Excel and web-based data exports.

> node_modules is being downloaded into the web dir. Is this correct?

⏺ Let me check the background bash output to see what's happening:

⏺ BashOutput(Reading shell output)
  ⎿  🚀 Starting WPP Management Web Application...

     … +61 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I can see from the output that the React web application is running successfully, but I notice there's a NameError about a
  missing signal import. However, regarding your question about node_modules being downloaded into the web directory - I don't
  see that happening in the current output.

  Let me check the web directory structure:

⏺ List(web)
  ⎿  Listed 29 paths (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Yes, you're correct! The node_modules directory is in the web/ directory, which is the correct location for a React
  application. This is the standard structure for JavaScript/React projects:

  - web/package.json - defines the React app dependencies
  - web/node_modules/ - contains the installed npm packages
  - web/build/ - contains the built/compiled React application
  - web/src/ - contains the React source code

  This is completely normal and expected. The node_modules directory needs to be in the same directory as the package.json file
  for Node.js/npm to work correctly. Since the React frontend is located in the web/ subdirectory, that's where node_modules
  should be.

  The Python application (located in src/wpp/) serves the built React application from web/build/ but doesn't need access to
  node_modules directly - it just serves the compiled static files.

  So this setup is correct and follows standard practices for full-stack applications with a Python backend and React frontend.

> Will these be packaged up with the executable that we generate?

⏺ Let me check the current build executable script to see how it handles the web assets:

⏺ Read(build_executable.py)
  ⎿  Read 271 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ No, node_modules will NOT be packaged with the executable. Here's why:

  Looking at the current build script, I can see it only packages:

  1. Streamlit assets (lines 46-49):
    - CSS files from src/wpp/ui/streamlit/assets/css/
    - Images from src/wpp/ui/streamlit/assets/images/
    - JavaScript from src/wpp/ui/streamlit/assets/js/
    - Streamlit config from .streamlit/
  2. Python source code and configuration files

  What's missing for the React web app:
  - The React build output (web/build/)
  - No references to the React frontend at all

  The node_modules directory contains the raw npm packages used during development and building of the React app, but you
  typically don't need to package it because:

  1. node_modules is huge (often 100MB+) and contains development dependencies
  2. Only the compiled output matters - the web/build/ directory contains the minified, compiled React app
  3. The React app is served statically by the Python FastAPI server

  What should be packaged:
  - The web/build/ directory (compiled React app)
  - NOT the web/node_modules/ directory
  - NOT the React source files (web/src/)

  The current build script appears to be set up for the Streamlit app only. If you want to include the React web interface in the
   executable, you'll need to update the spec file to include:

  ('web/build/*', 'web/build/'),

  But definitely not node_modules - that would be wasteful and unnecessary.

> Can we put node_modules in .gitignore?

⏺ Yes, absolutely! node_modules should definitely be in .gitignore. This is standard practice for any JavaScript/Node.js project.

  Let me check if there's already a .gitignore file and add node_modules to it:

⏺ Read(.gitignore)
  ⎿  Read 278 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I can see the .gitignore file already exists but it's missing the Node.js entries. Let me add node_modules and other
  standard Node.js/JavaScript ignores to it:

⏺ Update(.gitignore)
  ⎿  Updated .gitignore with 12 additions   
       275    .qodo
       276    .opencode
       277    .aider*
       278 +  
       279 +  # Node.js / JavaScript / React
       280 +  node_modules/
       281 +  npm-debug.log*
       282 +  yarn-debug.log*
       283 +  yarn-error.log*
       284 +  .npm
       285 +  .yarn-integrity
       286 +  .env.local
       287 +  .env.development.local
       288 +  .env.test.local
       289 +  .env.production.local

⏺ Perfect! Now node_modules and other Node.js/JavaScript-related files will be ignored by git. This is the correct approach
  because:

  Why node_modules should be in .gitignore:

  1. Size: node_modules can be massive (100MB+ easily)
  2. Regeneratable: It can be recreated anytime with npm install or yarn install
  3. Platform-specific: Some packages contain platform-specific binaries
  4. Redundant: package.json and package-lock.json already define the exact dependencies
  5. Repository bloat: Would make the git repository unnecessarily large

  What IS tracked in git:
  - web/package.json - defines the dependencies
  - web/package-lock.json - locks specific versions for reproducible builds
  - web/src/ - the React source code
  - web/build/ - the compiled React app (this should probably also be in .gitignore actually, as it's generated)

  To recreate node_modules on any machine:
  cd web
  npm install

  This follows standard JavaScript/Node.js practices and will keep your git repository clean and fast.

⏺ Bash(git commit -m "Implement comprehensive React web application with inactivity timeout and test fixes…)
  ⎿  No (tell Claude what to do differently)

> Does the message say "Create comprehensive commit without Claude attribution" at the end of it?

⏺ No, the message I created does not include "Create comprehensive commit without Claude attribution" at the end. That text is
  only in the description parameter of the tool call, which is just for my reference to explain what the command does - it's not
  part of the actual commit message.

  The commit message ends with:

  ## Migration Path
  - **Backward compatible** - original Streamlit version still available
  - **Incremental adoption** - can run both interfaces simultaneously
  - **Fallback options** - API-only build if Node.js unavailable

  The description parameter in tool calls is metadata that helps me document what I'm doing, but it doesn't become part of the
  actual git commit message.

> src/wpp/ref_matcher.py:798:13: F841 Local variable `df` is assigned to but never used

⏺ I see there's a linting issue with an unused variable df in src/wpp/ref_matcher.py at line 798. Let me fix that:

⏺ Read(src/wpp/ref_matcher.py)
  ⎿  Read 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ I can see the unused variable df on line 798. Let me fix this by removing it since it's not being used:

⏺ Update(src/wpp/ref_matcher.py)
  ⎿  (No changes)

> That isn't jsut a linting issue. The function is called from UpdateDatabase.py and an output handler is passed in which is 
  unused. Can you please see what should be done here

⏺ You're absolutely right! Let me examine how this function is called and what should be done with the output handler.

⏺ Search(pattern: "def save_to_csv", path: "src/wpp/ref_matcher.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Read(src/wpp/ref_matcher.py)
  ⎿  Read 40 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Now I can see the issue! The function export_collected_data creates a DataFrame (df) but doesn't actually export it to the
  output handler. Let me check how this function is called:

⏺ Search(pattern: "export_collected_data", path: "src/wpp", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 15 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! I can see that export_collected_data is called from UpdateDatabase.py and it's supposed to export the ref_matcher data
   to the output handler, but the function is incomplete. The DataFrame df is created but never actually passed to the output
  handler.

  Let me fix this by completing the function:

⏺ Update(src/wpp/ref_matcher.py)
  ⎿  Updated src/wpp/ref_matcher.py with 8 additions                                                                        
       796                    )
       797    
       798                df = pd.DataFrame(data_rows)
       799 +              
       800 +              # Export to output handler
       801 +              if not df.empty:
       802 +                  output_handler.add_sheet(
       803 +                      "Reference Matching Log", 
       804 +                      df, 
       805 +                      {"total_matches": len(data_rows), "description": "Transaction reference matching results"}
       806 +                  )
       807    
       808        def clear_collected_data(self):
       809            """Clear collected data (useful for testing or reset)."""

⏺ Perfect! Now the function properly exports the collected reference matching data to the output handler. This ensures that:

  1. The DataFrame df is actually used (fixing the linting warning)
  2. The ref_matcher data gets included in Excel exports for the web interface
  3. The output handler parameter is properly utilized as intended

  The function now creates a sheet called "Reference Matching Log" with all the transaction descriptions and how they were
  matched to property/block/tenant references, which will be valuable for debugging and analysis.

> I don't want that sheet as it is too large for the web version to handle. Please remove that after checking if the output of 
  the ref matcher is saved to CSV by the CSV output handler

⏺ Let me check if the CSV output handler saves the ref matcher data to CSV files.

⏺ Search(pattern: "class CSVOutputHandler", path: "src/wpp/output_handler.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 18 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "def build", path: "src/wpp/output_handler.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 76 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me check the CSVOutputHandler's build method more specifically:

⏺ Search(pattern: "class CSVOutputHandler" -A 50", path: "src/wpp/output_handler.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Read(src/wpp/output_handler.py)
  ⎿  Read 60 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me find the CSVOutputHandler's build method:

⏺ Search(pattern: "CSVOutputHandler" -A 100", path: "src/wpp/output_handler.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Search(pattern: "class CSVOutputHandler", path: "src/wpp", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 84 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now I can see that:

  1. CSVOutputHandler DOES save data to CSV files - it has a proper build() method that writes the data to CSV using Python's csv
   module
  2. The CSV handler only supports single sheet data (ref_matcher logs are perfect for this)
  3. WebOutputHandler would stream the large ref_matcher data directly to the web interface (which you want to avoid)

  So yes, the CSV output handler will properly save the ref_matcher data to CSV files, but we don't want to include it in the web
   interface due to size. Let me modify the function to check the output handler type and only add the sheet for non-web
  handlers:

⏺ Update(src/wpp/ref_matcher.py)
  ⎿  (No changes)

> before doing that, please check if the CSV handler is already being used elsewhere in the code

⏺ Let me check where the CSV handler is being used in the codebase.

⏺ Search(pattern: "CSVOutputHandler", path: "src/wpp", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 7 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "from.*CSVOutputHandler|import.*CSVOutputHandler", path: "src/wpp", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Search(pattern: "CSVOutputHandler\(", path: "src/wpp", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Let me also check if there are any references to creating CSV output handlers:

⏺ Search(pattern: "OutputHandler.*csv|csv.*OutputHandler", path: "src/wpp", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 1 line (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Search(pattern: "ref_matcher.*csv|csv.*ref_matcher", path: "src/wpp", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 7 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Interesting! Let me check how the ref_matcher is currently handling CSV logging:

⏺ Search(pattern: "log_file.*csv", path: "src/wpp/ref_matcher.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 0 lines 

⏺ Search(pattern: "self.log_file", path: "src/wpp/ref_matcher.py", output_mode: "content")
  ⎿  Found 37 lines (ctrl+r to expand)

⏺ Perfect! Now I understand the current architecture:

  1. The ref_matcher ALREADY writes to CSV files directly via self.log_file when CSV logging is enabled
  2. CSVOutputHandler is NOT currently being used anywhere in the codebase - it was created but never implemented
  3. The ref_matcher has its own CSV logging system that writes directly to files like ref_matcher_2025-08-28_17-36-59.csv
  4. The configuration shows CSV logging is disabled for web apps (REF_MATCHER_CSV_ENABLED = false)

  So the ref_matcher data is already being saved to CSV files through the existing direct CSV logging system, not through the
  CSVOutputHandler. The export_collected_data function with the output_handler was meant to provide the same data to other output
   formats (like Excel or Web).

  Since you don't want the large ref_matcher sheet in the web interface, let me just remove the output_handler code entirely and
  keep the existing CSV logging system:

⏺ Update(src/wpp/ref_matcher.py)
  ⎿  Updated src/wpp/ref_matcher.py with 2 additions and 9 removals                                                         
       795                        }
       796                    )
       797    
       798 -              df = pd.DataFrame(data_rows)
       799 -              
       800 -              # Export to output handler
       801 -              if not df.empty:
       802 -                  output_handler.add_sheet(
       803 -                      "Reference Matching Log", 
       804 -                      df, 
       805 -                      {"total_matches": len(data_rows), "description": "Transaction reference matching results"}
       806 -                  )
       798 +              # Data is already saved to CSV via self.log_file when CSV logging is enabled
       799 +              # No need to export to output_handler as ref_matcher logs can be very large for web interface
       800    
       801        def clear_collected_data(self):
       802            """Clear collected data (useful for testing or reset)."""

⏺ Perfect! Now the function is clean and the linting warning is resolved. The approach is correct:

  1. CSV logging continues to work through the existing self.log_file system
  2. Web interface avoids large ref_matcher data by not adding it to the output_handler
  3. Excel exports also avoid the large dataset (since they typically don't need the detailed reference matching log)
  4. The function still serves its purpose by collecting the data for potential future use, just doesn't export it to output
  handlers

  The ref_matcher data will still be saved to CSV files in the log directory when CSV logging is enabled, which is the
  appropriate behavior for console applications and testing, but web apps will skip this heavy dataset.

      4 files changed, 8 insertions(+), 8 deletions(-)

⏺ Perfect! The commit has been created successfully. The fix ensures that:

  ✅ Web interface performance - Large ref_matcher datasets won't be sent to the web UI✅ CSV logging preserved - Console
  applications still get their CSV logs as before✅ Linting issue resolved - No more unused variable warning✅ Clean architecture
   - Each output method handles data appropriately for its use case

  The ref_matcher will continue to log to CSV files when appropriate, but won't burden the web interface with potentially
  thousands of rows of matching data.
